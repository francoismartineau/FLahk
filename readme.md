FLahk is an interface that sits over FL Studio. Its main intent is to speed up music production and add randomization to put the musician in unprecedented situations.

The initial motive was to completely change the way sound samples are chosen. The program can output files containing multiple concatanated sounds chosen randomly using parameters given by the user. These files can then be fed to one of my granular synthesizers. This way, instead of choosing sounds manually by browsing files, it can be done in real time without taking time or effort. Since choosing sounds is now trivial, creating new patterns/loops that use the sound library in unprecedented ways is easy. Therefore, the musician can choose generations and make them musically interact.<br>
This feature is a small portion of the whole project. It features:
- A module that maps notes using chords and scales.
- Complex macros that perform multiple operations that automate the keyboard and mouse by looking at the screen's pixels.
- Guis 

Throughout this project, randomization takes a major role in order to make every step of music production unique and to challenge the musician. (Sounds, notes, rythms, names, etc)

During the development process, I experimented with multiple keyboards and mice with specific roles, but this required a lot of physical movement. In order to keep my hands almost static while composing music, I now use virtual button pads that appear on demand or depending on the current state of FL Studio.
